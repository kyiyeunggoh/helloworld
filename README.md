# helloworld, this is a little about me...
Experimental repository

Hi my name is Kyi (as in a doorkey) and I am new to this. 

Ever-eager to learn and eventually contribute! I was a History/Politics major in London and am now attempting to optimise by doing a Master's in Quant-stuff in New York. There's never a bad time for coffee or aubergines. 

I hope to eventually link my repos to a new personal web-based project that I will be starting come 2019.
