# helloworld, this is a little about me...

Hi my name is Kyi (as in a doorkey) and I am relatively new to this. 

Ever-eager to learn and eventually contribute! 

I was a History/Politics major in London and am now attempting to optimise by doing a Master's in Quant-stuff in New York at Columbia. I have a side interest in Chinese history/China-related developments...a few links can be found here:

There's never a bad time for coffee or aubergines but it is always a bad time for laziness.  

I hope to eventually link my repos to a new personal web-based project that I will be starting come 2019. :D
